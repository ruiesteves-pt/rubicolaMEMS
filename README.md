### 1. Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Open the Windows Powershell and type in:
```
wsl --install
```
You might have to reboot your computer.
You can verify your installation by opening the command line and type
```
ubuntu
```

### 2. Install Python 3 on your WSL
Open the command line and type ubuntu (this will be required everytime we want to run the program, as it only runs in Ubuntu OS)
Then:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3
```
